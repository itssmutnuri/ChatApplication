# ChatApplication
(Major WIP)

A simple Android chat application using Firebase. I've made this to explore Firebase and Android.

This is a somewhat modified version of [Firebase Android Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) from Google Codelabs. All the registered users would be participating in a group chat, with all messages visible to everyone.  

I've changed the signin method to e-mail based and added a timestamp to the messages, and removed a feature which enables image sharing. 

TODO:
  * (Current) Enable one-to-one messaging.
  * (Later) Add an encryption layer

  ----WILL BE UPDATING THIS----
